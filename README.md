# TicTacToe
A 2 player game

Implemented using very simple HTML and Javascript, back when I was excited about flashy colors on websites and new to HTML.

To run, download the contents of the Data directory as well, and keep it and the Tic-Tac-Toe.html in a single folder, as the hyperlinks are of relative paths.

Or visit https://akshayub.github.io/TicTacToe/Tic-Tac-Toe.html to play it online.
